\section{System Architecture}
Below is the high-level architectural drawing of the system, illustrating the interactions between microservices.

All microservices are containerized using Docker and are written in Python. Some of them use the Flask framework and some FastAPI.

        \textbf{Microservice} & \textbf{Framework} & \textbf{Description} \\

        Game history   & Flask   & Stores and retrieves past game data \\
        Game engine    & Flask   & Handles the game runtime \\
        Collection     & Flask   & Handles cards and users decks \\
        User Editor    & FastAPI & Manages user profiles and settings \\
        User Manager   & FastAPI & Manages user authentication and authorization \\
        Gateway        & FastAPI & Routes requests to appropriate microservices \\

\subsection{Design choices}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Centralized Authorization:} (draft)Every microservice connects to the User Manager to verify the token header (so that i can get dynamic username). User manager logs out users when they change username, this means that if we used decentralized auth, a logged-in user could see its old username using an old token, also, we don't have a way to force the log-out of an user with decentralized
    \item \textbf{User Information Update:} We've separated the
