\subsection{Endpoint-based Service Interaction Smell - Proof of Concept} %RabbitMQ
\label{sec:rabbitmq}
The project requirements asked to make up for the \textbf{Wobbly service interaction} smell. We solved it mainly with timeouts as suggested.\\
Regarding the \textbf{Endpoint-based service interaction} smell, the requirements said to ignore it since it would've been difficult to solve.\\
We decided to partially solve it anyway in a single interaction between the \textbf{Game History} and \textbf{Game Engine} microservices as a proof-of-concept.\\
In this interaction we replaced the timeout with RabbitMQ, a Message Broker, that solved both the \textbf{Wobbly service interaction} and the \textbf{Endpoint-based service interaction} smells.
