\subsection{Green User Stories}
\label{sec:green-user-stories}

The project implements two green user stories that enhance the player's gameplay experience by providing essential game state information.

\subsubsection{Viewing Cards in Hand}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\colorednum{green}{1}] See which cards I have and which cards I have to play SO THAT I can prepare my strategy
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{GET /hand/\{game\_id\}} (Gateway $\rightarrow$ Game Engine $\rightarrow$ Gateway)
        \item Returns: JSON array of card objects (\texttt{value}, \texttt{suit})
    \end{itemize}
    \item[\colorednum{green}{2}] who's turn it is SO THAT I know if i can play or not
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{GET /state/\{game\_id\}} (Gateway $\rightarrow$ Game Engine $\rightarrow$ Gateway)
        \item Response: current round state (empty, one card played, both cards played)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cloud Storage of Decks}
\label{sec:cloud-decks}
To allow players to keep their decks stored in the cloud, we added

\subsection{Client}

\subsection{Endpoint-based Service Interaction Smell - Proof of Concept} %RabbitMQ
\label{sec:rabbitmq}
The project requirements asked to make up for the \textbf{Wobbly service interaction} smell. We solved it mainly with timeouts as suggested.\\
Regarding the \textbf{Endpoint-based service interaction} smell, the requirements said to ignore it since it would've been difficult to solve.\\
We decided to partially solve it anyway in a single interaction between the \textbf{Game History} and \textbf{Game Engine} microservices as a proof-of-concept.\\
In this interaction we replaced the timeout with RabbitMQ, a Message Broker, that solved both the \textbf{Wobbly service interaction} and the \textbf{Endpoint-based service interaction} smells.
This meant a new docker container for RrabbitMQ and running code to fill up the RabbitMQ queue in Game Engine and to ping it for new data in Game History.
\subsection{Test-match}
As already said in \hyperref[sec:test-match]{Test Match} we made a simple script to test the system. You can find it in \texttt{/docs/tests/test\_match.py}.
