# 🂡 Card Game Rules

## 🃏 Deck Building

Each player builds a **personal deck** consisting of:

- **8 cards** + **1 Joker**
- **2 cards for each suit** (♥️ ♦️ ♣️ ♠️)
- For **each suit**, the **total value** of the two cards **cannot exceed 15 points**

**Example:**
> ♥️ 9 + ♥️ 6 = 15 ✅  
> ♦️ 10 + ♦️ 7 = 17 ❌ (too high)

## 🪄 Card Values and Rules

| Card | Value / Cost | Rules |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| 2–10 | Face value | beat **Aces**, are beaten by **face cards** and **Joker** |
| J | 11 | Beaten only by Q, K, Ace, and Joker |
| Q | 12 | Beaten only by K, Ace, and Joker |
| K | 13 | Beaten only by Ace and Joker |
| A | 7 | **Beats all face cards (J, Q, K)** but **loses to all number cards (2–10)** and to the **Joker** |
| 🃏 Joker | — | **Beats every card without exception** |

## ♣️ Suit Priority

In case of equal value (e.g., two 9s), the higher suit wins:

> ♥️ Hearts > ♦️ Diamonds > ♣️ Clubs > ♠️ Spades

---

## 🕹️ Gameplay

1. Before starting the game, each player **selects one of his pre-created decks**.
2. In the first turn, each player **draws three cards** from his deck, then, in the following turns, each player **draws one card**.
3. Both players **play one card face down**, then reveal them.  
4. Compare the cards:
   - In case of a tie, apply the **suit priority**
   - In case of both player chosing the same card, both players win the turn (tie)
6. The winner(s) of the turn **earns 1 point**
7. The first player reaching **5 points** wins and the game **ends immediately**

## 💡 Examples

- ♥️9 beats ♦️9 → same value, Hearts outrank Diamonds.  
- ♠️10 beats ♥️A → Aces lose to numbers.  
- ♦️A beats ♣️K → Aces beat face cards.  
- 🃏 Joker beats **everything**.
