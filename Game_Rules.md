# 🂡 Card Game Rules

## 🎯 Objective
Win the match by achieving a **5-point lead** over your opponent.  
As soon as a player reaches **+5 points**, the game **ends immediately**.

---

## 🃏 Deck Building

Each player builds a **personal deck** consisting of:

- **8 cards** + **1 Joker**
- **2 cards for each suit** (♥️ ♦️ ♣️ ♠️)
- For **each suit**, the **total value** of the two cards **cannot exceed 15 points**

**Example:**
> ♥️ 9 + ♥️ 6 = 15 ✅  
> ♦️ 10 + ♦️ 7 = 17 ❌ (too high)

## 🪄 Card Values and Rules

| Card | Value / Cost | Special Rules |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| 2–10 | Face value | Number cards **beat Aces** |
| J | 11 | Beaten only by Q, K, higher numbers, or Joker |
| Q | 12 | Beaten only by K, higher numbers, or Joker |
| K | 13 | Beaten only by higher numbers or Joker |
| A | 7 | **Beats all face cards (J, Q, K)** but **loses to all number cards (2–10)** and to the **Joker** |
| 🃏 Joker | — | **Beats every card without exception** |

---

## ♣️ Suit Priority

In case of equal value (e.g., two 9s), the higher suit wins:

> ♥️ Hearts > ♦️ Diamonds > ♣️ Clubs > ♠️ Spades

---

## 🕹️ Gameplay

1. Each player **starts with 3 cards in hand**.  
2. At the start of each turn, **draw one card**.  
3. Both players **play one card face down**, then reveal them.  
4. Compare the cards:
   - The **higher value** card wins.  
   - In case of a tie, apply the **suit priority**.  
   - The **Joker always wins**.  
5. The winner of the turn **earns 1 point**.  
6. The game **ends immediately** when a player reaches **+5 points** ahead.

## 💡 Examples

- ♥️9 beats ♦️9 → same value, Hearts outrank Diamonds.  
- ♠️10 beats ♥️A → Aces lose to numbers.
